# Matrix Zero Setter

## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` matrix, the task is to modify the matrix in place. The modification required is that if an element in the matrix is `0`, then its entire row and column should be set to `0`. This needs to be done efficiently, utilizing in-place algorithm techniques to ensure minimal space usage.


This JavaScript code provides a function to set zeros in a matrix based on certain conditions.

## Functionality

The `setZeroes` function takes a matrix as input and performs the following steps:

1. Identifies whether the first row and/or the first column of the matrix contain zeros.
2. Marks zeros on the first row and column based on the positions of zeros in the rest of the matrix.
3. Uses the marks to set zeros in the corresponding rows and columns.
4. Sets the first row and/or the first column to zero if they originally contained zeros.

## Implementation
The implementation in Javascript is as follows:
```javascript
function setZeroes(matrix) {
    const m = matrix.length;
    const n = matrix[0].length;

    let firstRowHasZero = !matrix[0].every(val => val !== 0);
    let firstColHasZero = !matrix.every(row => row[0] !== 0);

    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (matrix[i][j] === 0) {
                matrix[i][0] = matrix[0][j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }

    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (matrix[i][0] === 0 || matrix[0][j] === 0) {
                matrix[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }

   
    if (firstRowHasZero) {
        matrix[0].fill(0);
    }
    if (firstColHasZero) {
        for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            matrix[i][0] = 0;
        }
    }
}
```



## Usage

```javascript
// Example usage
const matrix = [
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]
];

setZeroes(matrix);

console.log("Modified matrix:");
matrix.forEach(row => console.log(row));
```

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m*n) - The matrix is iterated over twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - No additional space is used, modifications are done in place.

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently solves the problem with minimal space usage, making it suitable for large matrices where space is a concern.
